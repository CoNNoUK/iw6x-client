# IW6x: Client

![iw4x](src/client/resources/logo.bmp?raw=true)

## Download

- Grab the latest build from <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/momo5502/iw6x-client/artifacts/build%2Fbin%2Fx64%2FRelease%2Fiw6x.exe?branch=master&job=Environment%3A%20APPVEYOR_BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE%3DVisual%20Studio%202019%2C%20PREMAKE_ACTION%3Dvs2019%3B%20Configuration%3A%20Release">here</a> and drop it in your Call of Duty: Ghosts installation folder.
- The client is still in an early alpha stage. It is far from being usable and will have bugs!  

## How to compile

- Run `premake5 vs2019` or use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `build\iw6x.sln`.
